## What is [this](http://i.imgur.com/FgNaDU3.jpg)?
That's a courier.

## What is [this](https://github.com/aburgd/courier)?
This project.

## What does it do?
It randomly generates a build for Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas (2010).
The build may not always make sense (read: probably never will) but it's just a proof of concept really.

## What's in the build?
Currently, it spits out a set of [SPECIAL] stats, a set of [skills], and a set of [traits].
